![Kapoor mirror](/public/images/kapoor_mirror.jpg){: .right-image .keyline } 
I'm lead developer for [Claritum](http://www.claritum.com), a SaaS procurement platform. I don't look quite as strange as in one of [Kapoor's](http://anishkapoor.com/666/Guggenheim-Bilbao--2010.html) fun-house mirrors, but close.

## Geeky me

I'm weakly typed. I do PHP, Python, Node, Bash - anything truthy. But I'll do Java too, if you make me.

I'm a data nerd. That used to mean Postgres, but I'm rusty. These days it's a lot of old MySQL. NoSQL is hype, but I play with graphs for fun.

I guess I'm a devop too, if that means being a cloudy sysadmin without the pay.

My laptop's a Mac, my servers are RHEL. My smartphone is 7 years old.

## The rest of me

Enjoys sailing. My brother [writes about that](http://www.rogersrants.co.uk/), tho.

## What's all this about a crow?

Oh, you know. Years back you decided you needed an avatar. You remembered a character from a comic strip some delinquent newspaper published in your Pacific North West youth. Apologies, 
[Mr Millionaire](http://www.maakies.com), I nicked him.
