title: Hello Crow

So here it is, a blog by me. Over the years I've been coding (um... many, too many years) I've relied heavily on the gems wonderful people have found the time to post. All along I've meant to start one myself. Hell, the world needs my genius. Maybe I'm just shy.

But today I decided to get to grips with this [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) thing that github.io uses for blogging and grabbed the [simplest theme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) I could find. And here we are, up and running in minutes.

OK, so the colours are a bit stark. But then again, suitably crow-like. And you don't want to see what happens when I try and get artistic.

### What's it all about?

Over the last year I've been getting the BI side up-and-running. Previously we had a fairly expensive [MicroTragedy](http://www.microstrategy.com/) around reporting. This time round we had a very limited budget, but at least I'd read up on data warehousing and thought I knew the direction we should take.

We settled on [Pentaho](http://www.pentaho.com/), mostly because it's open source and promises all the  tools we would need in one place. Our one key requirement that Pentaho doesn't offer out the box is multi-tenancy - the ability to host multiple client's data in a single instance, so they can see reports of their own data, but not data from other tenants. There isn't a whole lot out there about how to get that running. Hopefully I'll be able to add to the general knowledge.
